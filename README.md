# GnomeStrongholdFisher

Fly fishes at Gnome stronghold Relevant ABC2 implementation. 

Was used in DMM but no longer interested in fishing in DMM, as swapping has become a bitch. 

It can bank or power fish. Banking uses WebWalking, which isn't as good as dax's WebWalker. It also doesn't have a GUI to choose whether 
or not you want to powerfish or bank the fish. You have to do this manually via adding the relevant nodes to the collection in run().
